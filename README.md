# Java Command-Line Calculator

This is a simple interactive calculator built using Java that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The calculator runs in an infinite loop until the user enters "exit" or "off" to terminate the program.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Perform addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`) operations.
- **Interactive Loop**: The calculator keeps running, allowing multiple calculations until the user decides to stop by typing "exit" or "off".
- **Error Handling**: Includes checks for division by zero and invalid operator inputs.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Simple command-line interface that prompts the user for input, making it easy to use.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers (`a` and `b`).
2. The user selects an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
3. The program calculates the result and displays it.
4. The user can continue calculating or type "exit" or "off" to stop the program.
